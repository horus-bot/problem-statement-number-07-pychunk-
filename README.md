Description: Develop a platform that encourages mental well-being through daily 
activities and reflections. Users can track their mood, engage in wellness exercises 
(like journaling or meditation), and participate in challenges that promote mental 
health. The platform should provide users with insights into their mental wellness 
over time and offer tips and suggestions based on their progress.
