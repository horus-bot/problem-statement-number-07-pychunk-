                <p>Studies have shown that individuals who practice yoga experience reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. This positive impact on mood can be attributed to the mind-body connection that yoga fosters.</p>
                <h3>Mindfulness</h3>

                <h3>Meditation</h3>
                <p>Moreover, the meditative aspects of yoga encourage introspection and self-awareness, providing tools to cope with stressors more effectively.</p>
