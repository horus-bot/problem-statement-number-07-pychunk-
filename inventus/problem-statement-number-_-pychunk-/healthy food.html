                <h3>The Role of Nutrients</h3>
                <p>Vitamins and minerals like vitamin D, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids have been linked to better mood and reduced symptoms of depression. These nutrients support neurotransmitter function, which plays a crucial role in mood regulation.</p>
                <h3>Mind-Gut Connection</h3>
                <p>The gut-brain axis is a complex communication network that links the gut and the brain. A healthy diet supports a balanced gut microbiome, which can positively influence mood and mental health.</p>

                <p>Healthy eating habits can improve sleep quality and duration. Foods rich in magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and cherries, can promote relaxation and better sleep.</p>
                <h3>Sleep-Inducing Nutrients</h3>
